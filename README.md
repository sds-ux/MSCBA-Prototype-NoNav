# MSCBA-Prototype
Prototype for MSCBA first developped in 2019 by Jason Rodrigues. 
We used it for usability testing in late 2019 and early 2020.
  The goal was to refine a different approach to task navigation called Web Application Matrix (WAX).
  The documentation from three rounds of testing are in MS Teams: https://014gc.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/PortfolioWeb-Intranet/Shared%20Documents/Secure%20Digital%20Solutions/MSCBA/Usability%20testing/Testing%20results?csf=1&web=1&e=fi78aS
