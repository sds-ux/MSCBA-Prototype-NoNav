    <p><strong>8. Accuracy</strong></p>

   <p>9.3 The Commission disclaims all liability for any loss or damage arising from the failure by the Account Holder or any User(s) to protect usernames, passwords, Authorization Codes or account information, including the Account Holder's failure to meet its obligations under section 9.2. </p>

   <p>11.3 The Account Holder must inform Users that their access to the ROE Web Account will be revoked where there is reason to believe that any of the circumstances set out in section 11.1 occur.</p>
